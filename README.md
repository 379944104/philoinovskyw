# Parallax ImageScroll - jQuery plugin

JQuery and amd compatible plugin to create a parallax effect as seen at [spotify.com](https://www.spotify.com).
Really simple to use with some options to tweek. The plugin uses css3 transform for animation where supported and falls back to top left positioning for ancient browsers.

[Check out the live demo](http://codepen.io/pederan/full/cEvDh).

### Markup

Markup can consist of as many image elements as you want, but you should seperate them with a content block, e.g. a section.

```html
<div class="img-holder" data-image="anImage.jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900"></div>
<section><p>Content that "slides" on top of the images</p></section>
<div class="img-holder" data-image="anotherImage.jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900"></div>
```

You can use html5 data attributes for all the options listed below or set the options in javascript

### Initialization

To initialize the plugin apply them to the elements you want
```javascript
$('.img-holder').imageScroll();
```

### Options

You can configure the default options, by passing an option object to the plugin, like this
```javascript
$('.img-holder').imageScroll({
        coverRatio: 0.5
    });
```

or set the options globally

```javascript
ImageScroll.defaults.coverRatio = 0.5;
```

Configurable options are:
* image: The image to show (default = null)
* container: The element to which the parallax image(s) will be attached to (default = $('body'))
* speed: The speed of the parallax effect. A floating number between 0 and 1, where a higher number will move the images faster upwards (default = 0.2)
* coverRatio: How many percent of the screen each image should cover (default = 0.75)
* holderMinHeight: The minimum height of the image in pixels (default = 200)
* extraHeight: Extra height added to the image. Can be useful if you want to show more of the top image (default = 0)
* mediaWidth: The original width of the image (default = 1600)
* mediaHeight: The original height of the image (default = 900)
* fallback: If you do not want the parallax effect, e.g. does not work very well on mobile (default = false)


### AMD

The plugin is AMD compatible. To use with e.g. RequireJS, you can do this. See demo files for example.
```javascript
require(['jquery.imageScroll'], function (ImageScroll) {
    $('.img-holder').each(function () {
        new ImageScroll(this).init();
    });
});
```

### Requirements

jQuery version 1.8.3 or higher

### Limitations

Does not work very well on mobile. Check for touch and set fallback option to true.
